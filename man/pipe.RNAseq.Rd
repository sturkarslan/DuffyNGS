\description{
The top level all-in-one function for turning raw RNA-seq data into
wiggle tracks, transcriptomes, etc.
}
\usage{
pipe.RNAseq( sampleID = NULL, annotationFile = "Annotation.txt", optionsFile = "Options.txt")
pipe.ChIPseq( sampleID = NULL, annotationFile = "Annotation.txt", optionsFile = "Options.txt")
pipe.DNAseq( sampleID = NULL, annotationFile = "Annotation.txt", optionsFile = "Options.txt")

pipeline( sampleID = NULL, annotationFile = "Annotation.txt", optionsFile = "Options.txt")
}
\arguments{
  \item{sampleID}{
The SampleID for this sample.  This SampleID keys for one row of annotation
details in the annotation file, for getting sample-specific details.
The SampleID is also used as a sample-specific prefix for all
files created during the processing of this sample.
}
  \item{annotationFile}{
File of sample annotation details, which specifies all needed 
sample-specific information about the samples under study.  
See \code{\link{DuffyNGS_Annotation}}.
}
  \item{optionsFile}{
File of processing options, which specifies all processing
parameters that are not sample specific.  See \code{\link{DuffyNGS_Options}}.
}
}
\details{
Turn raw sequencing reads into final results for that type of data, building various files of results along
the way.  \code{pipeline} is a wrapper function that looks at the annotation field \code{DataType} to dispatch
the correct pipeline tool.  Main components:

\code{\link{pipe.PreAlignTasks}} Setup. Create the results directories (and 
cleanup of any previous files) prior to running the pipeline on this sample.

\code{\link{pipe.Alignment}} Alignment.  Turn FASTQ data into the various types of
alignments via the Bowtie2 alignment program.

\code{\link{pipe.Transcript}} Transcription (if RNA-seq data).  Turn alignments into wiggle tracks and
transcriptome(s) for all target species.

\code{\link{pipe.PostAlignTasks}} Optional post-alignment tasks, like de novo assembly of 
No-Hit reads.

For a typical dataset, this can take many hours and is often configured as a batch job
submitted to a compute cluster.

\value{
a family of data files written to disk, and a text log of all details sent to standard out.
